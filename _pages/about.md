I, **Data Storyteller**.\\
Crunching numbers on a daily basis and having gained a Master's degree in applied mathematics, I am a strong advocate of using data narrative to grasp the world around us.

I, **Education Lover**.\\
Constantly developing myself and having been actively involved in several educational organisations, I am determined to use my passion for learning to add value to other's lives.

I, **Events Enthusiast**.\\
Helping increase audience interaction at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/) and having led teams to organise numerous events, I believe in their power to shift mindsets through impactful experience.
