# About DataViz
**DataViz** is my personal portfolio site garden â€“ place for putting data visualisations on various topics, whatever catches my eye but mostly inspired by the [MakeoverMonday project](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/).

If you are interested in the backend of things, this is a customised fork [flexible-jekyll](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll). Feel free to check out the full source code on [my GitHub](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/some-vizes).

# About Me
I, **Data Storyteller**.\\
Crunching numbers on a daily basis and having gained a Master's degree in applied mathematics, I am a strong advocate of using data narrative to grasp the world around us.

I, **Education Lover**.\\
Constantly developing myself and having been actively involved in several educational organisations, I am determined to use my passion for learning to add value to other's lives.

I, **Events Enthusiast**.\\
Helping increase audience interaction at [Slido](https://www.slido.com/) and having led teams to organise numerous events, I believe in their power to shift mindsets through impactful experience.
